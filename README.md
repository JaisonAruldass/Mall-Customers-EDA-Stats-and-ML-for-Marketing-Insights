# Mall Customers Analysis: EDA, Statistical Tests, and Machine Learning for Targeted Marketing

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the [Mall Customers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers), aimed at segmenting customers for targeted marketing strategies. The project includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps) and summary statistics to explore customer demographics (Age, Gender, Annual Income, Spending Score).
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - **T-tests** (independent, one-sample) to compare Spending Score by Gender.
  - **Z-tests** for large-sample comparisons of means or proportions.
  - **ANOVA** (one-way, two-way) to analyze differences across customer groups (e.g., by Age or Clusters).
- **Machine Learning**:
  - **KMeans Clustering**: Segments customers into 5 distinct groups based on Age, Income, and Spending Score.
  - **Random Forest**: Predicts Spending Score (regression) and cluster labels (classification).
- **Business Insights**: Actionable marketing recommendations, such as targeting young, high-spending customers (Clusters 0 & 3) and converting high-income, low-spending customers (Cluster 2).
